## Reandom thoughts

> Tsonkh means "Window" in **Mongolian**

I usually code, develop, configure, and administer listening to DSBM, eg Kanashimi, so focusing :)

I think Vim should add <kbd>Leader</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd> and <kbd>q</kbd> to save and quit easily using shortcuts by default.

The same is true for [surround.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) to be integrated.
